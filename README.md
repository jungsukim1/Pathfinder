# Pathfinder
Welcome to my pathfinder project
I worked on this project for about a week over the winter break.
This project finds the fastest path from one point to another.
The algorithmn that I implemented for this project is the AStar algorithmn.


How AStar works:

It is an advanced breathe first search algorithmn

It calculates the least possible distance from one point to the next

F = G + H
